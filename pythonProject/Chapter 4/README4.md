# Chapter 4 - Lists

 1. *lists*: it is a value that contains multiple values in an ordered sequence:
    1. [1, 2, 3]
    2. ['cat', 'bat', 'rat]
    3. spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat']
 

2. *Lists* can also contain other list values:
   1. spam = [['cat', 'bat'], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]]


3. Negative Indexes: While indexes start at 0 and go up, you can also use negative integers for the index. The integer value -1 refers to the last index in a list, the value -2 refers to the second-to-last index in a list, and so on. 


4. A slice can get several values from a list, in the form of a new list 


5. Getting a List's Length with len(): function will return the number of values that are in a list value passed to it, just like it can count the number of characters in a string value.
